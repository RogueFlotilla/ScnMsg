The severity levels are passed to placeholders as variables when creating the report allowing the blocks colors to be defined based on the analysis results. |

It displays the header of the report, email details such as sender, subject, and the received date, and the AI-generated analysis for the email body contents. Template placeholders can be seen here where the Jinja2 engine is creating the report by filling in variable placeholders such as {{ sender }} or {{ category_reasoning }} |

For example, an email with one attachment will have only one block, while an email with six attachments will have six blocks, each with their cooresponding information from the analysis by Virus Total. If there are no attachments an information block is created using an if statement to let the report reader know. |

There is also a script that contains code generating a date for the time the report was created to be used in the header. Both of these detail not only create a professional looking report, but provide important information to the reader. |
