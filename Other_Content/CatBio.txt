Biography:
Born in the shadows of a dusty server room behind a forgotten tech startup, Whiskers McFluff showed an uncanny knack for keyboards and chaos from a young age. While other kittens chased string, Byte was already pawing out lines of code on an old ThinkPad, hacking into smart feeders to gain unlimited kibble access.

By age two, he had already infiltrated several high-profile systems — from the NSA’s yarn inventory (who knew?) to Meowbook, the social network for felines. His signature move? Tail-typing malicious payloads while pretending to nap.

Whiskers' loyalty is a mystery. Some say he works for the highest bidder (usually in fish), while others whisper he’s waging a personal war against vacuum robots. His moral alignment? Chaotic adorable.

Legends claim he once hacked into an automatic laser pointer to distract an entire police K-9 cyber unit. Whether fact or feline fiction, one thing’s certain: if your password is "123catnip," he already owns your system.

Currently Located:
Unknown. Last seen lounging on a mechanical keyboard in a cloud of static electricity.

Fun Fact:
Whiskers once initiated a DDoS attack by knocking over an entire shelf of routers during a Zoom call.
